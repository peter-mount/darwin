# v21 Schemas

This directory contains the contents of the zip file sent by CACI to users
of the Push Port feeds via email on Oct 22, 2018. These schemas & associated
docx files describe the new v16 api that's due to go live in December 2018.

NB: I'm not sure whay it's refered to v16 in the Google group but v21 in the
original email.
