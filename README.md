# Darwin
go library &amp; suite of microservices for handling the NRE DarwinD3 feeds

The main purpose of this project is to consume the feeds provided by National Rail Enquiries in real time and expose that information as a REST service which can be consumed by a client, usually a website.

https://departureboards.mobi/ is an example of one of these clients.

The documentation is in the [Wiki](https://github.com/peter-mount/nre-feeds/wiki)
